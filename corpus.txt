parents as at you to see it and see us never did and in years past and he completely forgot about the movie until one day as he twenty seven year old metfield it to you on your home dag and he realized he could finally papillae a dream well that's never happen to me but if it did it would be with the two thousand for trash his sleep of her tearing the girl friend's pike some other notable casting choices you at jane lane she got three larson who is just kind of bare anyone even peter who for some reason is playing the same exact character he played on philiberte breakout fresh paranoia place sir completer soon moves his arms and roulades you know a serial work he gained by it none better i would think that that's just how he talked but i'm almost ninety per cent sure it's not also steep corral is in this movie for some reason i guess because this was still a few years before he started making enough money to turn down roll and even though his character is basically just pulled large i gates he nails he gave everything he had to the move that did not deserve it i love moves from the two thousand start with this ancient man logo it makes it seem like you're about to watch like chet city bang bang and men at that out an a kid in hela's rolls by a five second end and we already have movie trope number one where the bell rings and everyone runs out screaming brewing multi coloured papers into the air unexcused tell me that if either the last day of school or it's the first day of school at the worst school anyway and we need our main characters julian hanna seen here giggling and unionism reading lisselan time really mistreated outwore that line because that will be important later it may not seem like a big deal but you take that advice to heart i have great on lucidly wrote her party invitations using ransome letters it also must mean that the family of the person she could not get it in the mail classic measure my dad as i can have a tiedeman for none for man is my dad in jail but i guess he's not what you protest away that is he perfect glimpse into what yates character is supposed to be in this movie she's just fat i'm not saying she pat and i'm not saying that matters but what i am saying is it the writers only wrote for her that she is overweight and she likes food and you'll see more of that later but that's her whole character sometheeng two pictures of herself in a coma or did she call me springeth day julia it's really upset when the cool kids drive by blasting yellow carnation i did but what i did a boss instead they had done it a high school that he'll be attending next year and there browbeaten good treats for four years every day for lunch i'm going to do a ten and ball into that dumpster and much on whatever i find oh he my precious coming wow he's beautiful and he looked so similar to the stunt double is face was on screen and slooshed malay to can't be me not at all you are maybe you did see you but he was just confused line eight grater was doing outside of a high school so is it a summer break for these kids to where they all still there go home middle school ends and all the kids screamin the top of their lungs and trash the whole way high school and at every one just like mine if we keep sidney or all that we i have an unlady but party man i'm fourteen not for years for about a second for me to figure out what the story line between the moment her daughter would be a seat if you will be the party to night my little baby amatore now i alone for now i disagree but by the end of the move i will tell

molinaris what a tattine bob and go ter spend but er it's one of my miss it well i think a moment here to point out how poorly dubbed some of these lines are with the switch to a voice over as soon as some one turns her head but it's very obvious that witness let me get it this time so i use so we said get to dance to the way they do this is example basically as long as some one's mouth is out of a shot to replace adeo with an adieu want it you didn't even notice that i'm doing that right now what he want more than anything in this world and he think anything ultimate anything by his five scavenger and eng winning groups the boutonniere losers edith the dempsters no problem the first part of the score on the need to make a dating profile on a website an if you're worried about it not

scrunching sock is tortuous milk were the bad girl every albanian come up and realize all the girls are gone good thing julia ones for wigs that match each of their individual horstile a good nestor's big moment came south mistook on the side i never wave at me oh what am i saying no by every way that me i'm that remember that my friend he ance would you rather eat sore or browning let is that a triestine exactly so just take this like brownies in so i never thought about it like that and since liking food seems to be the only personality traits the writer's gave me that makes a lot of sense of mexico had to the club to meet their day for earlier and totally unrelated their teachers also there abound total right to my god is a great flat wasn't to related to dubhe gigaboo like a tent regnier because she put on sunglasses i won't you like a commodation notice that is talking to a fortune year old what's it like being a sensual i'm cold questful fine one that doraine amount of time to give in to bind the girl from gingerale asinus over there dancing his heart out seems like every one's having a good time except for heise's all alone in the cold sitting on a pallet but here comes up boy what her name unclehood in course of course the guy who likes her is also kind of chapeaus it is movie teaches is anything that people can only datah other and they could only be happy if their interrelationship i'll never happen i mean sometimes they ask me to hold a diligent about an i would never ask you to it live in your fish in my life be milder still hated it the teacher i wish it would stop and her friend has some advice for the old guy listen your tie ticket he took a different ages would i guess i look exactly the same you want a dance for it she ambrose what do you sit with movies over estimating the effect that glasses have on a person's appearance regular glasses make you a hideous monster and sun glasses make you invisible i love to get home he cannot have oh but it did and i geologised up in that one shot problem presented self what do i do looks off screen object she is aboard down a hill she jump over a dog and visit a big moment here up the guy she likes stop at a stop sign as she rolls on by and he falls in love instantly was and it's important because he saw her polite for seconds and decide that his dream girl i mean she rides kate board he rides gate board what if we kissed at the skate part as ever the biggest on the list she has to go into steve's house and steal his boxers which he asked is very weird maybe that's why they had all those fine mareens earlier because this is their version of the party radiant how come all of these characters just nowhere everyone lives o we gotta get some from teahouse the guide never spoke into in my life yet i have to address gamey but sin peeps justitiam red with the back of her head as she is with his feet he is trying to find her at his old aerolite the is the girl we can see her hobbies do include scapegoat ing as well as hotdogs i also love to hadaka portington said total package she's also hiding him my shower right now but i don't know that and it eeaste elinora nothing a point out here about crevier the is especially if the roles were reversed but whatever you know is just a moving the heat but lately for her right before his extremely need body steps into the shower where she is there's a distraction of side giving her an opportunity to steal his undies they drive away victoriously into the net home gosh ticketing i added it back can you imagine if that really happened but now what does happen is in spite of their under age and reckless driving they get away with everything and see coral driven to some garbage can to this cocotte final act of the movie where everything collided at the high school dance but first they have to figure out how to get at otaheite it oh i don't have one sorry as no to get no dance no what she goin to do i know who you are i do you're out here collecting tickets and to a being inside it the day you spend your weekend doing after carting algebra or he play way too much not lyle your parents or is she now than you ever eaten anywhere

your holy conversation would have done in real life look of her you and i both know that you rope ascetic loser whose never going to do anything with your life but to night you hold in your hands the power to help me but you another the popular girls boyfriend from earlier is kissing another girl can you believe it he insure it came her mind about the dance sisitote about earlier why didn't you kiss me the holliwell because it's a desolate ten per six months but i know he he is the assayer they should be mad at him he cheated on both of them why have they fighting each other even going as i said the berating while this green day look like ten plays in the background and touched pistoians like this i think in dimples which will win them the dance contest orawo it looks awesome think you as bustle that occasion the liberation of saronia partner yea it severo here you so hattie years older than you i faintheart forfeited over the only personality trade you gave this girl but it makes it because this is a movie about people who fall in love based on one day and you know i saw you boarding earlier than that and i saw you but in some more she happen one to get into it they make a back home in time for their mam realizes that left the house which is good except julie never got our kiss may be the next morning that sucking weirdo stood in her tree house all night waiting for her to come out so he could stick his hand around the corner and surprise her i can as is a score shouldn't be looking at this these are children well tacitly she's a child at the atlas steve is twenty two years old at the time of filming which makes sense because that is exactly the age that he looks to the movie and what a fall till fund fact about sleep over the budget was ten million dollars but they made ten point one million dollars yet at what we in the belike the call a profit at it the same that the say this revues promise and god by meditantis movie is very cool and funny and way but

all much i have your eye pack botello know actually i'd rather say i'm so grateful for everything i have and this is turning out though the best thing giving every heart of you to mitigate it is a really good to disuse the moral of the video is you should always be grateful for what you have a lot of times we get so busy wishing for all the things that we don't have that we forget that the someone out there that's wishing for all the things that we do have it so important to appreciate what's right in front of us and if there's one thing that of learned in life it that won your grateful for all the things you have god lets you have even more things to be grateful for so always have an attitude of gratitude now let's hear from some one who i know is a very grateful person rickie what did you think about this video i thought i was absolutely beautiful i love how he learned a lesson in the story i would say that just even as far as the sleeping bag the bed on a lot of people don't realize they have a wonderful company bed to go to sleep in and that a good night's sleep as the time something that people don't have and that's something the need to really be grateful for just the good nights leaf wow i really love that so during my conversation with ricky a few days ago she mentioned how things were always easy for her and her family but one christmas when she was growing up she received a very special gift that changed her life for ever let's go at and take a look there like a one special memory that comes to mind when we think of the holidays at this particular holiday was tristan and we were struggling my mom with single parent we have you no she didn't have a lot of money but my mom to my oddny mom a muti want something so bad and i was a little astonied just kind of expected it and you know the things we would only happen a certain kids in serials would you know son among the money but i don't know how she did it i don't know how she works hard most of her life my mom worked hard for all six of us children i ever walking in the living room when i was a little girl and long behold there was his metal one beautiful doll with a red it with an herewith a yellow dress most tearful dress and it was a cabbage patch all the actual cabin petal and my mom had with able give caps passover with everything she wow but since we are on the topic of gratitude if your mom was here i now waldeyer old mom thank you so much for everything you've done i did not always understand why you did things that you did a setting that she said but i know that you were always trying to protect us you were looking out for the best of us you wanted to his make sure that we were all okay and i'd had no idea how hard your life at been being with single parent of six children and insisting that you had to go through so it is loohooloo your mom and i thank you so much for everything and so beautiful a he thank you for sharing it with us and see your man eso proud is there any advice that you want to give the darin him on the topic of gratitude oh yes just um no matter what one one thing that i do even now i don't have the most of everything i have been interesting living lifestyle everything but i always take time to notice that in being since serenaded by god all the time oh if i'm having a bad day i look of the window and i i see there's a lot of grain suddenly there's a tree or a bush with pink flowers and i take that as something like hay as one to be okay it could be anything well a little bird or a humming bird might come and visit you there's so many things to be grateful for even in when you're having the worst day in the hardest time you live there's always messages and reidesel thereunto that say he were watching you the angels are here god here you're going to be okay you got this just keep a going your own the right path and sold just the was a small things just notice thank you so much recofer sure now really appreciate it so eden if there's anything you want to give the dar man fam a on the topic of gratitude while as you say yeah on i think just being grateful for the little thing this malines as like even a smile or a complaint when i walk past owl either so i always try to do them and when some doesn't to me it is making felsenstein and instigator in people do that so i think just appreciating the small things and you know ben think for what you have in the people around you and those who are there for you also therein okay so what's go ahead and mean to video number two this story is all about kindness it reminds us that one small act of kindness really can make a big difference let's go out and play video number two which is called this lady has no one to eat with on thanksgiving until a stranger changes her life dunstan thanks having aloud fredoniad side he's me oh how i istar any one oh yes i is my family and i would love thee to join us in giving and that's my house right there go on inside and we already have a platinotype you god has he a less you do men think giving alone right nansie oh hi what's going on here oh ah my family and i we are hosting a free thanksgiving dinner it's open to every one you're welcome to you mean tell me your letting complete strangers into your home to eat a free dinner how man was really going on here well i lost people have nothing that evening giving or no family and i with so i i just wanted to do something night besides once mid the kindness on change a person's like a imbarak you don't seriously believe that do you well i look you think seating a stranger a free dinner is going to change their life you wasting your time for ye i do because it changed my life i see growing up it was just my sister and i ween everything giving gether cooking food and enjoying dinner together but then one day she got really sick and ended up in the hospital she kept getting sicker and sicker until one day she was gone and i'll never forget that next thanksgiving for the first time in my life and i said this began i just pesetas too hard to be there so i left the hum a little while later a couple saw how sat austen they found out what happened they bite me into their home to eat then it with them so that i would have spent thanksgiving alone nothing safer replaced my sister nothing there but rather first high and on the long high intactness orageuse of that combat was able to get to the hardest thing gitter had then one at the kindness chantyman i wanted to think not on sorry her by her sister but people go through hard times all the time you feeding them one thanksgiving dinner and quantitate their wife it real it excuse me i i i is everything okay oh yes everything fine i just wanted to say thank you so much for

have been ninety thanks giving every one don't spend it alone come join my family for a friedinger did you see freehandedness side to march but why you this well a wise person once told me one small active is contained some one's life go on so the moral of this video is one male active kines really can make a big difference in some one's life you really never know what someone's going through so i should never underestimate the power of listening smiling how being or simply carrying and the best part is that your small act of kindness can have a ripple effect that can help change the whole world so always be kind to others now let art to catherine who definitely knows a lot about kindness not just or the character she plays but also in real life so catherine would this video means to you can never know when a little word or something you might do with a small gesture is somebody can be having the worst day and they may at that will it be like i am done with this world unnoting on and something you do pain for their groceries or opening up the door it whatever it is gives them that bit of hope that makes them want to try another day i will go to so touching thank you for sharing that catherine so next we're goin to talk to someone else who appears in this video a lizabeth i wisbech you play a woman who lost her husband and spend the holidays alone how did you feel

you okay i i can spend things in with my family in an you see i was just like you i parents always wanted pentit me but i never cared i remember last thing giving my dad wanted me to play at with him before dinner but i brushed him off he told them though and in my mom asked me if i wanted to be cookies with her but i told her i was in the middle of a game it and completely ignored her tether sending their boerse so sad and when it was time for things giving dinner all the one was rested down an eat with them so we could be together as a family but i can even care o that i went to pleecemen since ten and then a few days later my parents went to visit my grandma i was so busy that i didn't even bother to see by the emenangin there was no comedietta bouton the way in the one is

to share with the dorman fan to give them some advice about the importance of family it absolutely i would say if he have any type of grudge all you have any pipe of ill filling with any family member let it go because you never know that you never know when this last time that you're going to see them in a life is unpredictable we all share life we all breathe the same air but the one thing that we don't have control over it what happens in life whenever know if there's going to be a accident never know if there's going to be a harriette into that come up or a fatal ill illness we don't know that so just because they're here to day does it mean that they'll be here to morrow i thank you so much carleon up your heart with this i got me howard to speak are here we really really appreciate that carl never fails to touch so many hearts and with his story i'm sure there's so many people out there once again crying okay so now let's go ahead and watch our fourth and final video as part of the first ever holiday special this fort story is about love it reminds us that holidays are not about how much money you spend there about how much love you give let's go at and play video number

you smearing that's what you brought little gaoses he where did you can buy those annual in blin't buy them in my sin i we bake them gather i begged and he aided first you shall up at my christmas

son er friends wife had to invite her all right every one is time for the white elephant at her re somber one that's weapon smart choice that was from leicester ornament thank you so recruits or of sky i know we said twenty five dollar limit i come on the cool rely followed that within number two i chose it may be on us another less no i all ready choris this up and made more men it looks like a cost less than a dollar a palet me guess this one came flammy son i repainted it to get there every might me i went way to get the materials than ninety nine cent store but if you don't like it you you get always a trade it for no i don't want any one else to give to with this some i tourtres elder you god alone help one of these hushai asked for her i know you're going to love them and do open

christmas present unyoro mind giving a moron i don't think you understand what holidays are about beseemed not be able to afford a dancing cookies from an award winning chef but my son and i put a lack of love into the cookie and that is what matter and i may not be able to buy expensive things for the white elephant exchange but i put a lot of time as to decorating that ornament with my son and to me that means a lot more and i may not be able to afford a lot of christmas presents from my son and a but i teach him to be grateful for everything that he gets no matter and that matters more

in a dedication is you up me and the life of the big

in an absolutely got wrenching moment orter back joe or was carted off the field after suffering a pretty severe looking left in the injury while come back everybody on doctor brine suitor and the chaumber one source for learning about the unique medical side of the world of sport and stands video are going to break down the entry to quarter back joe borough in what certainly looks on first glance to be a very severe angry for the rest of quarter back as always at hand goering about this unitatis forts please consider craving to the channel and betrayer a twitter from oriel time break down an analysis and let's get started at the time of recording this yelloish word is that he's been ruled out with a left andre so this is the play where burr was her weak conches just let go the ball and his left leg is in full extension meaning his knee is straight and that legs lock straight he then basically gets pinched between two defenders here one to fender that's kind of falling into the front of his knee from a little bit at the outside looks like and in a second offender on his back that's causing him to even push forward even more so he falls into this position where his trunk is flexed forward his left leg is extended and it what proceeds to happen next as it looks like that left leg gets pushed back even into more severe hyper extension we can see even to at this moment that trunk flexor ward to ninety degrees and were already starting to see what looks like a little bit of hypertension that left leg he can't really catch the ankle down here as much but it looks like the ankle might have gotten rolled up under him a little bit and then it just gets even worse i mean here in this clip now it just look at house over that left leg is hyper extended with likely a little bit of a valgus low because of the defender coming in from the side to see it a sense of where his knee and is kind o worthy orange sock start is actually right about his knee and so in this position i mean his knees so far down close to the ground falling how much loads being implied on it so the concern here for me is certainly a multi lament pretty serious left knee injury that looks through been caused from a forced hyper extension with likely a bit of a valgus load meaning of low that's being directed from the outside of the knee inward if we leave this new model basically that means the defender in the forest came in from the outside and come up pushed backwards and end which forces that need of band and then hyper extent a couple of things are always worried about within the hyper extension are certainly going to be the acalan the p c some studies that have applied it just a pure hyper extension force on to the knee i found the round thirty degrees when we start to see that a seal and p c become vulnerable looking back at this clip of burrit certainly looks like he's approaching that position this reminds me a lot of what happened with raven's tied in nick boiled just the other week those acalan pigments are running north to south withinside the knee and so whenever you hybrid stand you put excessive stress on the ligaments now because there was also what looked like to be a force that kind of came from the outside in push in and that's when you start to worry about this in seeling stretched as well of course you've also got a worry about them in this hessian type of a serious injury like this you've got a worry about cattle tearing and you've had so many other structures back here there's the postal aural corner repetitur s the commander with these hypertension type injuries so a lot a lot that can be going on here beyond just the typical ligament injuries now on the medical team and i get out there and this is what a evaluating is a couple things a minister with first initially we can see the burro's grabbing at the back of his leg and really based on the location is grabbing it's hard to say one way or another if this tells us a specific injury to me this tells me that he feels like his knees on stable that he feels like he has to support and hold on to his knee for some reason or another the first thing i'm going to be doing when i get out there a side for making sure the athlete is breathing and a stable is looking to make sure there's not a joint dislocation or what we'd call a compound fracture in asking the athlete what hurts what are you feeling what are you remember happening and this is where they're going to cleon to where the pain is say something like i felt a pop and give you an initial sense of where to start that about ation this team work is great you've got one of the medical staff that's up at his head kind of guiding him through asking him questions and ye've got somebody else that's coming down here getting ready to stabilize that joint if needed to this is great work now they've got him a little bit more comfortably positioned at better evaluate this left knee again there providing since stability they're going to start doing their assessment to look first of all is their concern for a joint dislocation are their fractures when need to be worried about aether more severe really high energy type injuries we need to stabilize the next thing we see the medical staff doing here is it looks like their basically palating meaning pushing on the kind of front structures of the knee of course on the front of the neest your knee cap or the patella and the get your patellar tend in and if i look back here miss maybe you roughly looks to be what the medical providers are looking at here initially you can tell the contact there hands kind of almost like they're gennaro pinch him move that ligament around our check on the kneecap this is it really palpitantly along any of the ligaments on the inside the outside so i'd wonder kind of what they were doing here initially that cause that to be the first thing they looked at and next year it looks like they're getting ready to look at some of the ligaments now the specific maneuver going to do is something called the lockman test where you basically are trying to stabilize the theme and distract or pull the tibia anterior or up forward that's what the clistin to restrict and so the asels torn your lockman test is going to show no clear firm in point no catch whenever you feel that ligament engaged hartill here may be there is like a little bit of the loss of an impot there but without being there and really feeling in yourself you can't speculate on what you're just seen tether thing to keep in mind as with a picter you can actually kind to be food with your lockman from something called a poster sagi when the piece is torn in that position the tibia will sag and drop down below the femur and so when you do your lockman it feels like there's a lot of movement but is actually because the peel is so damaged that you're kind of getting this falsely positive lockman you'll finally all this is reassuring we don't see a bracer any sort of an air cast on his knee that tells me they weren't as worried about a dislocation or a severe fracture so that certainly seems like a good sign so well wait to see you was the exact final diagnosis is but based on limited review again to me looks like a nee hypericon with a little bit of a bowood from the defender falling in from the outside but definitely got to be worried about multilayered and selectae pecan in everything else like the manicate post relate corner of really a wide differential here that could have happened for none of them really being that good said i for the video ebody thank you as i for watching let me on equations or comments on below in a onesimus later by 

on that i am rising up here told you as what i have to go with to this bilious become not derivative i reckon up and that is because he first glee in a menominee son of horses and an i really wanted to make the video frogs because you all deserve the true we actually never talked about relationship said the idiot alayor do for i get into it i wanted to latinise much respect for ben and he is like what a way one of the best people i ever met my entire light and toonie had ever met slid down a reuerend and good editions my art for ever and able in her few like the literally no matter what i your few he was if you get it in boyfriend on still your fidenae same preached a inundate at call and he a relationship has been very up in the air and i know that his pen super confusing for you and that is because it's been just as confusing for us we've been very on and off again and and i don't think we were really sure able we wanted to do it and till now and that's savourily making him a video for you guys i had it in three years ago yeasaid talk to them for about six months a horseman what a single word yet not i i was like a income friends and then that developed into a little more and as you know three years go by and i think that now we run nine thus made we were to set her as friend having relationship is one thing but have relationship on mine is a completely different story i am and it was very effusing for us and honestly he was just kind of it was musing likely where we were fifteen and sixteen the baby when this all started whether in the most changing years are live we went from teenagers to a dull panaetius throughout those years we changed his people and an after his benite makin video as one of the most amazing things and we both out so much fun doing within a tous went on i just became a little too complicated and little confusing i think that was hard as we want to make you as happy as well as in ourselves happy but i think ultimately we fit in to both i think what must import was focusing on ourselves for now at the same in the future we won't ever be together and this in like a forever thing as the last think right now it's not the right time and like the sad and we likes the group together on me ever really had that like independence as we can plait everything together and i think that now we realize that we can as need to be a little more independent and i think the white doe to see friends for it now you sinuses you know we're friends for i know it doesn't mean that you know like he can't go and do her on thing in your americanizing a matter what in whatever she chooses to do in the future is relate her in words one and said ban and next girl a good lad you're going to need it as he spartiate risorius because brand is says he jus to trading with a broom breathe brokenness i connaissait were not going to ennismore oh my god that brought my heart the scanderoon a pradier and never the habit ever and say that i'm going to miss bretanskeye guys made had picked up on this and a elaine haven't since he got here for a little while now and it's unsanitary how i do it and we were sure to us how we felt a but i think you know if the reason were making the videos because we finally come to a conclusion about how we feel and we feel as if right now we're just better of his friends he thou intently at it break out in a people either the franconian man been in promise each other we three years ago that like whatever happen will always be friend regrets that promise which were on a hold or promise and soprano i mean without being said as can expect to you know excuse together as crimeometer and things we untether anointed on tamanoir undoes a reasoned don't think really anything else to say to me for every one is ever watched a video of us together we want to say than he gave to man and she so much for supporting us washing the videos of ye lay together to be one of the most invading things to be able to evidenceth and really coonly when an elan change it for anything i wouldn't do for the world and we love you is literally so so much as the target that is pontifical so you love you guys and i'll see you guys and all but in

look forward to virtually victor dwelling

the trap me i know also yes your correct every one is pregnant right now here's a thing ye i wasn't sure that i should say before i got pregnant i was damned her i was never going to post about it like ever at any point even after i had the kid em and i was still feeling pretty resolute about that after i got pregnant am but i just i don't know i still don't know where i am out with a basically i've had this conversation with like my friends a million times i had my parents of militia was madame i am to my therapist and and i'm just recording them seeing how i feel and if i feel good but not be for your watching instance whatever but also i posted in twitter just a no context pole saying do it or don't do it to be cathalina make major like decisions am and you gastados it was i was having a good laugh because a bunch of people were responding being like is this for see bees of your brand and there was also in personal but like just as a bank man is not first be of my brand although it's so funny because i do have samples right here in my show the door also for those i didn't watch the pot castor here and another round about way sam and launching a make up round a thesiger real there's lots of light and anciently an i mountshire hopefully in janooary were mere everington that's a long chair right now i'll do like a piously a big fan you tuber revealed that you it won't be a bigger on it'll be basically exactly like this but i'll be talking about the lyon the silky by going to get ready while i talk to you about this i'm not going to mention anything amusing to day because it's just like a bigger fish to fry you know but i read that my fate that'll be like noticing any product moblike there the mitigating marietta a moment this meal on bad oh my god but let's take a sick moment just to discuss how an appropriated is to speculate on people's fertility mother and all they are pregnant et cetera there's just no need for it that's the truth of the matter so you know there's plenty of reasons i people wouldn't want to talk about having kids in the first place this plenty of reasons why people might not be ready to share yet or ever if they are pregnant especially in mine and i realized in those people you know our going into those kinds of commences with the best of intentions but is a tricky one masai that's a delicate topic so i think just like out of temescal for every one lets not i thought i would able to find this pregnancy for like quite some time like i felt pretty confident of it and i knew that there would be the people that have been pregnant before and so they kind of recognized you know those changes and the people's way in different things like that like evanescently physical indicators but i was shocked by how quickly before asking me about it i was doing a live and i would have only been about like maybe eight leagues and some one said something to me in a live being like the brightness and in every life that i've done since then it was like more and more people being like when he so what's going on like a just a nonnenwerth hide apparently a hesitant i share about this because an i'm goin to do aaron talking you but musing christ's allatini not much singeing that and think it talk about the penalize before i might have talked about a video not here i have them bear with me i have always struggled with with what i want to share on line and what i don't want a share it should be a simple as either sharer down but i think it's tricky to be his you know spent like most of my adult life long line and sharing everything i've been going through so you know like break up and relationships and marriage and buying a house and mental health problems and all i can estefania all those things like me you know we end up talking about quite a bit and so that is something i really used to doing and also you get really used to you being able to crowd sortes tion like it's so simple to deflate jump on flutterbies pages with your fever it take me you able piper you know like thing like that and just being able to get a lot of opinions quickly from people as convenient and is also nice it feels like a sense of community and you know like being able to connect with people and so i kind of dispatches because you know with a jab it can be quite lonely like i've been working on my own since i was to any save seven years be completely on your own is like its pretty thought in morning all say that and so you know being able to talk what my life has made it a lot easier to cannilie and feel some sense of like you know community with others so that adam had the conversation with my farfan of recently i think this was actually a fore i got redness but i have a saying that you know it's hard looking back through my career unlike his lost seven years because every high light on every like positive ing and happen in my career or my life as soon as a pope my mind i think about the shot i think he or things get the time and then i like move on so like the good feeling to both and so making a bow putting this news in hands of the internet as at a so anyway that was my kind of reservations iron my life felt a little bit differently about it my serapis was like oh post that shed she kepenau is because what i was fond o struggling with his life does mediating about it like a satiny taking up power back or is that me actually giving all the power to the internet you know and is basically what my herbisse was like you know like you deserves to experience this and be able to share like anyway elina you know the more time that have had to sit with his news the more than i'm like am i really going to like tell my parents that i can't post oetaeans of course my family would respect that and you do like atwood respect that and in our friends and everything i know that they would but a severe is it so i've got on becancourt here says that it is an roadway to relate of one disclaimer against any one an i found out one timber thirteen leave usually go for dinner my parents house every sunday you know un covet permits and so that particular sunday we were over at my parents house and my period is always pretty regular like its rare that a edile a daylight coating i think it two or three days late on and i just have a feeling about it and as were driving home from my parents house no was like a just stopping get so pregnancy tousand that was like old aryan i was like to question me like i do like it ill feeling in my heart because like a mother you know i mean em and as i was grabbing the dust off the shelf i was like this is a man i too had such a weird feeling about it and sure enough there it was i don't have like recordings of the er anything because like he really hard time with i like to experience new on my own for like ye i don't really like the insubres i don't really like people watching my reaction the thing i kind of liked to jostle privately take it in and have a moment also i don't know an i am a little bit of like an emotional person so my whole life pass before my eyes just paineth the task came up pregnant m and i just like satisfaire to the house like they have yes that's talkin that an we had kind of talk bodikins man we always manikins like it wasn't ever a question i'm not for her but matt is seven years older than me then he's been really like unhold on it for sure after we got married he was like subnatural exit but the idea that in kids and i kind of was just a little bit more hesitant about the idea because obviously i'm not as old as him an what i thought it would feel like at this age because i when i was younger i wanted to have kissin her twenty five like that was like the oldest that i wanted to start having kids up when i was twenty five you could not have convinced me that it wasn't a legal for me to bear it ildabaoth not a ananias i knew that i was working on the fitness and that that was going to require like a lot of time and then i do a channel obviously like my personal influence plainsman then i have the pocatello and then make my life as well and also depression you know it was kind of the idea of having a kid in that as well but nothing's changed by the way all of those things are still happen so it's not like the circumstances of jane in any of those directions but an i wasn't ready quite a sickly after marriage is not was but we had talked about trying for kids and it's insita interesting time because when i was younger i mean obviously close yours and not much and my friends were having care or trying to have kids or like that at that point i really didn't realize how commonly fertility issues are and so now you know i know several he bothered issues i've watched people on mine that have fertility issues just like talk about it at length and so you know in many had started talking about like okay maybe we want to start trying and stuff in my mind i was like well tis is going to take a while you know like to susan going to be an over night thing was going to happen really quickly like the probably going to be trying for at least a few months m and i remember before i got pregnant i had asked my amalie how long were you in dad trying for him i always like one we decided and then we were like and that was basically daly what happened like i according to my calculations i would have been off berth control for like oak so we were definitely like very very lucky in that respect like i just canteen i magine dealing with retulit issues when you want a child and like i can only imagine that that just makes you want grow and growing grow because you know it's something that you steal like you like should be able to just do and so i just have so much like oh god just so much compassion for those partners that want that so badly and a struggling were very fortunate in that respect it was definitely a ecoute like a little bit off guard because i i just lose mafeteng it basically i won't expect me to happen that fast i do i was like sinking back till like all of those like as the time like or like insects that cause and high school new belike it only takes the one who i be like if i can germans i just sat in the athanor a little bit with a little pass and then a machinelike it's birdie it was like or a and pregnant and then he was like quote sucker good as this is so is that isn't the most mad reaction you've ever heard in a don't know what else could just like the really some of his bersonin out in no universe with i going to wait stormonth to tell his old was akin atri do not know how anybody had the world power to do that immediately i was like welladay parents house like i went to go tell them right away so we drove back my parents literally dis told them in the doorway which like a man i have to say like i've been loving i look at always lack like watching videos of people like telling her family finally that the pregnant self and like coming up with his really creatoid as like i love those that yes i could not work a straight bat because just having to having to like hold that secret for evenly an hour and longer would have been an absolute night martin said now it happened we drove my parents as i like handed on the pregnancy test in they were like a man then that we went to mascarille my brother because my one brother and the pure my parents on some old as brother and that my middle brother lives in a different province so i called him and the tale and we drove to a prose we told them by the time that we had like gordon the pregnancy test come home taken a ring as he has gone my parents house gone him as parents house come home a list was still not sucking home from the gem it was like nine thirty at night and i was like sitting in a this room were like i'm sitting right now looks on to light the drive way and so i was like to sitting in the sonlike waiting for a life to come home and i teeter being like hay when you home and she was like a i'm just looking for saving with a story which i was like you could not be looking for a smaller bucking item a reciter to at least a norther merica or in canada in say i don't know what it's like out else but satronius sold in living credibly small packages because it's so expensive to sores and nurses like looking for so ronnie bucking if i so i waited for a lie to a feller satronian en she drove up and i literally like racial out there handed her to pregnancy depend she was like as it is immediately with like sobbing she the pike for niobian and like the pelican is even within mere amberbaki is like me all down on the congregated and we have like camera around our house that record noise to call was like i just pushed it back and as susie and she liked i clutched on to the presto test the old i am and then like after me out there for over long she was like you give up and then i could not clettini was just so like beside myself i just felt like no matter how i was like laying down that i was like squashing it somehow and so i do celia super rustles a bad night also i should mention i am this is also another one of the reasons why i was kind of hesitant for a while to have kids i mean he's so many reasons be hasten i am like so terrified of dying during alberto race especially for white women and canada very low like not hialti i don't know why it's just like a weird i mean is not weird or even like a rational i would argue but i just i'm so terrified of it and a clever months go i was like just a panicking about it when light for some reason a and was like to going about it and stuff and i was watching videos of like women getting first like lenoir crying being like a wicket was just like i'm like so it so terrified so a abetted up all night after i got now and i just was like trying to be like how my going to do this man my cow my going to mentally how magnitudes like physically that's one thing just like mentally home i going to make this happen you know and i also this is a thing i'm so emotional in some way is okay sorely strong feeling about the city it is day before i found out but talking to marabout how i was kind of nervous to get pregnant as well because of how society in general a treat a people once they get pregnant like threw my adulthood as a woman am i been realised is heartening i guess to experience how a little women are like valued and am how much their questioned and you know all these things and so am i feel like i've spent a lot of mice a dull life so far really fighting for this like place that i have in the world to be like taken seriously and for people to like listen to what i have to say and you know anything in business as a woman like it's been of really interesting time for me and to a singapore i don't not that i was like you know i hasten because i hope people treat pregnant women are soft like that and he was a cowman and i was like you know not in not in for a not to see in pregnancy but man like like people like once you become a long all ready women are like questioned about what they're doing am or not doing and the choices there making would you become a man it's like suddenly like from what i've viewed from alchisay if thee a floodgates facinating are maise entitled and like so maritime their opinion to you and having an opinion what what you're doing and tito making those comments like to look at your kid you know like and i just oh it just makes my word boil em and so talking about this not like you now like its hard like ice my whole life i watched a people who got pregnancy talked down to i bought long be talked down to i've watched people talk poorly about mom or pregnant people and it's hard to just like knowingly walk into that and say sure like when i feel like actually somewhat secure in where i'm at as a woman never out right now you know because i do feel like a senserunt in a lot of ways with my experience on line because in you know there's a lot of people who have communities that aren't as i guess excepting my community doesn't often put me down for like generally speaking he to mount the majority of people dump put me down to things so i he know if i want to post a photo completely naked on my instigate long flowing hair covering my boots people are like yes that sounds perfectly reasonable you know it's like a scary almost being like o like as i can a change like our people going to steal relatively about me talking how i talk and expressing myself how i do and taking photos the way i want and dressing how i want and all those things that you know i have always just taken my soltali ri felt and also like you know kind of in a same vain with people having such strong opinions about what women do with their body but especially so during pregnancy and motherhood selibrated with is some the people that makes common to both people under the guise of being concerned for their health so you know people that make shalymmen towards people that are overweight and their like well i just don't think we should be glamouring obesity and like are you actually concerned about this is this something that you gislebert like do you are you really actually genuinely concerned for their health because of interesting becky that you're doing cogimar house and then your own twitter and telling this other person it's completely unrelated to you justicer to even slightly that your comfort their health it's just such an interesting dynamic and that is who rampant within like the topic of pregnancy it's just such a tricky thing regardless like even without the pressure of other people you are any have that pressure on yourself you're all ready concerned able everything that you're doing in every decision that you're making an like how is it impacting my health howieson the health of my child like is is going to be something that like long term is like horrifically bad is a gnashing at right now we think is totally safe in sin and unlike twenty years from now they're like oh my food they think it smoking was fine so i just think i chateauvert unnecessary and if interesting even like in resorts around pregnancy am like books and website and stuff like that i'm like time just astounded by some of the language is used in the sun book that i was reading this talking about a triton and so like that which obviously pregnant or not nutrition is arguy important but something that temesvar important is like having a healthy relationship with food and not feeling ashamed of the fact that light food is more than sufferance from me like a associating and it's a thing that makes me happy and i enjoy preparing it and it's just like like food is like everything to me like that is like my whole shed okay and so am this bothers reading it said it was a talking on a frisian and there with a little like kind of blur but the bottom a and it was like what to do with your homer and it was like askesis what i'm craving healthy for me and my child is as beneficial for me and my child and i actually hungry or in my board emotional et cetera and am like either all questions i'm never going to happen some one in hundreds going to eat because i thought the angry i did however read this book that was a pinamonti suggest you read it tatyana and you feel similarly to me about feminism and the pantry ard e i think i'll really really like it it's called like a mother and i spy angela garb it was just unreal it was like super informational but also just like a real good emotional journey for me i went into pregnancy feeling a lot of pressure and feeling a small kind of life just feeling like wall like this is the beginning of me being treated worse by by people around me like i sanity not like my direct circle but in general a and i like last that books feeling like super empowered and far more excited about you no motherhood and is just see so refreshing to read because so many different logs and and books and just resurgere like they are so like just like there's like a little just like a low key undertone of judgment was like every abit of his vice of being given because this is a thing like a course obviously people should be able to research what's advisable and what's not based on science but i think that it's the sismondi's just now mean to couple it with the saint credible judgment i have my own decisions men about you know what i want to do in my pregnancy what i want to do a during motherhood wataitee madeary i be but even though i know what's right for me that literally has no bearing on what's right for you and i have got a say what a suckin pleasure it is to be pregnant alongside christie it had been the most comforting experience ever crossing we don't we laemke the same decision regent not like the same people but we have similar views on a lot of things but mostly we have a similar view on like live and let live within reason obviously and so it's just in so nice till like half someone that's going through it to talk to you and like you know bound feelings aloan fears and questions and all arkinsaw you receive any kind of like changing news whether that's like good news or bad news like you know maybe you were someone in your family i really sick or you find out about a pregnancy you and whatever it's like it's so i grappling with that and excepting that the world still turns you know like frou like everything is at a fancy in your like polchinello this is all that there is for me to think about i mean the people i have rongier i like the most like incredible like wonderful loving people a but i definitely had been i being able to talk to christie whose like going through it kind of thing as a same time i'll give watch her video i iver she and alathea i cannot even crito tories been view when we look that videos been bowed one point six million times i'm the point six i've walked matteo thought in countless im and i cry every time it never gets old like it is the best publishers ever could this is the thing again i love that she like i love that like the emotional jury like take on different experiences like pibayo it but i just can't do it like i just don't have the willpower to like make those things happen but i've loved watching her like hole pregnancy journey because i get has been so like my god like coin your family like after like your liver do let me likeliest like mozart worming thing and any have beckoned desaver there who like the most it's just like i guess this is my thing how is it that some one that was already so glamorous you became exponentially more glamorous weron child so like watching both of their journeys and bent like so interesting and like so cool for like to like very different reasons while herds of actually emotional to and i just criait duino interesting watching other people go through this sanginne through myself so anyways i'm here to give you a really boring take on it we didn't sell finding of the generating like that we did tomkin anybody one we defiant basically esoteric reeling into you anyway i was planning to talk about paramore and i defended up complaining about the siety i do that every bucketing man covetise melodies i know you want me winter came putting on lois was two agressive so that we coeratadas am in response to that pramathanath ask me but i want to read the comment i guess but well well no here sing i'll go only in stature a day i'll both these only instigators that david i possideo asking loquenti you guys have for me and elsie in the next video probably also for those of you that are concerned that this channel all now be only about pregnancy

more to pressing them when you get cold sir or ma'am that happens when your thirty maybeso my cool earring that people don't do that they see that and i think oh wait a minute this did definitely scabbards he he is not sir yes for he's not sir he's sam rice number four you get excited when you go to a concert and there are chairs at this point i will be excited to go to anything in public it be excited to go to any event if they were allowed to happen i would love that and i would go if they were safe i would be esteban also i've had back issues for fucking ever so this is s been a thing for me i hate shopping i hate standing for a long period of time it sucks because of diving and my how it bukoba permanently and your story to think twice before buying passes to music festivals that go on for days i went when i was twenty set when i was twenty six or twenty seven i went to a music festival in serbia that was five days straight twenty four hours a day for five days and it was no problem no problem now i can i guessed i could barely go to any i can barely a can barely got sheeping but this one is true you don't get white kids say that don't trust any one over thirty surely they're not not a but you right you're you're one of the cool ones all is a picture of a fat it spinner he drink for that oh also who has ever said don't trust any one over thirty who said that who said that a wise as a mother tucker i got lessons and my head all right grass always granted there's one right there the post may is always cold when i get to you be there's another one when you tell stories from high school you're often struck with the sun realization that they happened over ten years ago oh i i what is it worth i school feels like for fucking ever ago i'm not shocked to it's over ten years ago it all i was twenty ten years ago i would almost graduate from college when you re watched the movies or shows you grew up with you now identify with the parents more than the kiss though dametha i just bucking laugh at a busy had offered clodomiro that you get pissed at your neighbors and tell at them to turn down their music when they throw parties in the middle of the week yet you tell that at them they quiver there tryacle unlife like this this is like when you're sixty what's going on you can't leave home without toms or petto or whatever else you take to control your digestive system i'm fine what do you mean i'm ithacan eat anything whenever actually i probably should bring tombs with me or some i get i get pretty guesses doni got to be honest and i just think that it is a matter but it probably does and probably going to get stomach answer one day from that you'll take any escuse to leave a bar or a club too loud too hot too many people and so on and so on yet right now i definitely would do that the days ere you could drink whatever you want with a having a terrible hang over the next day or long gone that's fucking damnthing for the last five years stood where you been busied in fact sometimes your hang overs last two days now and there is no amount of gay rider great of food that is big the edge off a you take some bocher the first time in your life for some reason this one actually as kind a true for some reason because i don't know why but i've i've started to think a lot more about like skin cancer and supple that but that's a thing for any one that's not like a thirty year old thing nessus everyone should be wearing some walk all the time i don't know why we don't but this should be us all of us we should all look like this all day even at work fourteen you said the phrase i'm getting too old for this sincerely stopped with these ponies of seniors what is it this sophronia's not us all right it's not me i do like to nurse a martini every once in a while though i had met all rock some pearls all right she's to tuck in killing it though this is a rock star right here fifteen your back hurts when you sit down for two long or like comedian her when you stand for too long or when you move at all in a direction and for any reason you know i would have made fun of this one but i i just said like five minutes ago about how my back is all messed up all the time so and i threw on my back like twice this year just breathing so they are one's right to a credit cards are suddenly something you spend a lot of time focusing on and worrying about now what do you mean i spent a lot of time wiping amaurosis can't decide if you want a dog a child both or neither well guess what i have a dog aimed a year to dragon now so why would i even need you madgie of this point hold on hold on i'll fix this i'll sixtus hold on you you still can decide if you want a dog a child both or cubberd drag and yea something you have to feed like crickets too for ten years yeah i get to have live cricket in my house for ten years now a oughtta is awesome i love having a plastic intender full of live crickets in one of the rooms of my house it's awesome and don cremona all and don't give him give me the evgenie's i have a worm in my frederigo fugitive worms i'll cool as that i love it when you travel you prefer to do so with a little dignity gone or the days of packed hostiles with twenty five bunk beds as true true but also this is also because i just have more money now and think it's cos i have like grown out of it i just think it's like i have the money on my as well not stay at out asses were fun we sat in awful from as a year and it was like this great i met a lot of great people a lot of them were over thirty

and you'll tell any one who will listen abel your pot okay maybe this is this is this is more accurate than the last for some reason poop i found myself talking more about pop it's weird that as you get older you just revert to being more of a child but like nothing nothing is really funny to me any more it's just puling and for that the stuff that's funny at that just on that stuff is just pure it's so it's just funny to the core nothing on top is not nothing you not trying too hard it's just pooping faringhea's you constantly wonder how your parents had a career house and children by the time they were your age i mean i have a bearded dragon you hit that point where you stop buying clothes purely for style and you start to consider how comfortable they hear no no no these magnesia i really hope i mean i expect this to happen to me at some point but it hasn't happened to me yet and i'll think i like warrint then look good still or at that i think look good you're getting to that age were technology is starting to confuse you and you found yourself asking for younger people to explain stuff too recently look at his picture what are you doing what are you doing this lady is ninety this is lesley is ninety that's not me all right he i'll give you a little bit on this one tiktok kind of confused me for the first little though better maybe i just like rejected it i didn't want it to be a thing because i thought it was stupid but the ustiushka thirst traps and lips sinking i dthought i was dumb a the beginning and it was done now it's better it's funny or now there's more is more good show on there you come back from the supermarket with a lot more fruits vegetables and fiber now so much fiber yet for all the poor talking about no ah my diet as gone worse for sure this year as definitely been a struggle in terms of making myself cook and eat better it's like it's just it's only gone to easier to order deliveries ically with everything going on like when we did want to go to the grocery store to the tatihi is orangery all the time and then i just it's hard to eat well when you're ordinery all the time i know i like i could get a salad but that sounds like it's goin to you know it'll dry out but time i get here so osceola you don't know who most you tubers are that's got funny i don't know who this is should i know this is i like to think i know who most beauties are seeing as i am one but a i don't know what is it so maybe that's right you're a lot more interested in calm and relaxing hobbies than you used to be like knitting her guitar or painting or adult coloring books what the fuck is that who do etelklein books why not just paint a picture that's a thing adult colouring books o do well this is weird fuoco of iris on colouring self care for the self corntassel swearword colouring book during covenanted mic trot you know what i got out eupeithes a fundin believe tis the cabellian looby is right now by now i love bingerdon every go you know what i'm an come back to this one in a week and may be i'll resonate with this after my new colouring book arasmon and saying twenty eight when you have to pull an all night or off for some reason you spend all night wondering how the hell you could pull these off and i school as often as you did okay this is one thing i got to be honest about sleep is more important than ever in my life right now all the anxiety i have all this is why i don't like relaxing things actually because i can never actually relax because my anxiety is constantly so bad and it's getting just gone worse that i don't like sitting there i can't sit still i twitch i fidgety watch a pocasse like constantly fishing because my brain is moving really fast and sleep is the only thing that works for me in like turning that off so if i don't get sleep than i'm fought for the next day when you look at yourself in the meretur to notice the wrinkles and crow's feet your parents used to complain about all the time no i still look to credibility and now you have to be in bed by eleven p m every night if not earlier or else we gettest one put the fust usually it's the usually the the end nooning positive

to you be on the two of alternately be we threw up the lad movie about that generally bad roland really not that the contrary oratiello internet welcome of bill the very show that tells jokes that booze with such ease for those jokes are filled with such cheese that the joke police might one day read my home and see three the keyboard they'll seize the lawsuits till tea and by now you're all shouting stop please to day we're talking about a doctor suis classic the laura celas tale of how flourishing forest full of truffle trees was reduced to a barnwell a businessman rolled in a town and exploits the trees for profit in it lassiter bout how something beautiful than every one loved him be ruined by greedy corporate interest and what better way for illumination entertainment freer of the minion movies to teach that very lesson to a new generation than by taking the conic story than adding an extra hour of run time now some people may call this an unnecessary cash grab a totally the gates the message of the original story what were you expecting a but at the end of that sentence i totally be gave the original messages a story but not nearly as much as the decision to take the pro environmental as i con lorrain your them to promote a massasoit or what richer anything like that just a gas guzzling as you and also a p printers and i hop and freaking come cast to see this the literati er is it called the point illumination entertainment he missed but see there not alone because when it comes to the laura movie audiences miste point too and be clear i'm talking about that movie itself and all of the stuff that was shelled into it to stretch that thirty minutes story into eighty five minutes of run time the laurelled seems to have a message that's pro tree adding with a big musical about how we all need to let it grow but if you'll really look at what's actually happening in this movie neither the one slur nor the new villa elishas o hair or to blame and yes i sang it sway remember how to pronounce his name every song in this movie is a bob moiself a questionable quality but man the songs are just to lifu obnoxious for ever and evolved on clear anyway the villain of this movie or the villains here rejoice all you one lure in griebler shippers all that a can they be not as bad as you might think you see meanwhile the characters at the movie is trying to cast in the role of hero aren't quite as heroic as they might see the long and short of it all is that no one understood this story which just a wee bit concerning since it a very little way the fate of the world depends upon its message for starters let's take a look at the main villain of the story as you may or may not know the classic story of the laura is about the one slur an enterprising business men who chopped down all of the trouble trees to manufacture these wildly popular garments called sees but in this new larem that's all in the past it's a story within a story in the president of the film were living in the aftermath of the one slur there are zero trees and the one city that we see seville is a synthetic consumers mecca run by a new business man has come the power alice's o'hare who built his empire on selling bottled air and recamier heroicly is a business man he basically just runs the plant and as don't secret please that try to stop our mean character ted when he attempts to sneak out of town to neville is basically a corporate ocracy a word that sounds like it was made up in a doctor so cook but now it's actually right here in the dictionary because truth is more ridiculous than fiction sometimes to business modellers air company were told is that bottled air is made an effect or which manufactures plastic bottle you know got a beginning merely think crepitating to buy this however search shows that if you put something in a plastic bottle people will buy at of course there's an obvious conflict of interest here to factories that manufacture or hares plastic bottles below which in turns rides more people to buy bottled air a more small and the sky the more briber look at what's going on oh here might not be the village that the movie sets about to be because as much as what i've described sounds like it is toby if you look at the actual lives led by the people in need villegiatura tells us a completely different story for starters the most distin part of this might be the idea that people are paying for air it be pretty dangeville harmonize the most vital resource of all then locked it behind a pawal forcing people to pay him if they want a live but that's not what's happening here not as if every one in this society is spending their lives stratton oxygen tank curtsie by bottled air for their homes let they can just go outside at any point and breathe the air for free in fact on the extended version of the opening song that appears on the sound track o hair straight up tell us this faction as if the erosite walks all that polluted people are dancing and singing in the streets without having any health concerns they're not coughing they're not struggling in any sort of way compare that to what the town was like before aliosha showed up the geoff different story wonder what the next million dollar inventions going to be suonetar quality was so bad that people outside of were indeed coughing and weaving what i'm getting at is that though people act as though this bottle there is something that they needed order to breathe the bottled air the by isn't really improving the quality of the air that they have access to their homes or outside it is pure placebat and we can prove it using science to closer look at those bottled air machines inside of people's homes we see that they dispense air from bottles that are civil to the standard water cooler bottles which are around a five gallons or nineteen leaders in capacity and something about that should strike you as of the average human breeds around seventy eight leaders of air every minute which is more than ten thousand leaders of air per day meaning that if the citizens of tenable wore only reliant on o'hara's jugs of air it would run out in mere minutes sartint get themselves some psychological boost from thinking that o'hare's air is breathing fresh air it's just that it's psychology not biology the fresh air that their buying from tohair is no different from the fresh air they get it they simply opened up a window while it's kind of like another resource we have in real life that's available to us that many obstinate for because he comes in tiny plastic bottles that claim to be fresh herding tomater here gus thought the metaphor was obvious enough but i feel like an dispelled our bottled watered o hares air is just the stand in for bottled water but one thing we can say is that before her the town was a wasteland thinks the large part to the one flirting down trees in the present and movies it artificially created utopia where every one is happy where the air is cleaner than anything that exists around it we saw how much voice land it was before o'hare and in the present day we see ted coffin smuggler when he leaves the city's walls as ten gets further away from the city the more air pollution there seems to be if anything neediest one place that seems to have escaped from this fate somehow by hook or by crook a wishes o'hare managed to create what it is i all account athribis city despite the lack trees the phone away to allow people to breathe three air even when they're not consuming his bottle there if you look at it that way oh here almost seems like a hero at the end of the move when we look out over the ruin was land it's important to understand that isn't what o'hare created it's what he had to overcome for his company and town to be successful and he did it the people are happy as we see in the opening song of the monikins consumers are clearly thriving happy about him happy about the city they live in welcoming his entrance in the city's new parking lot in a grand chorus in fact if you actually look at the living editions of people in need villas not bad at all for a movie that's supposed to be all about the woes of modernity and the harm brought by capitalistic greed we don't see any one in need vile that seems to be a real victim of o'hara enterprises we don't see people who are left poor destitute we don't see people who are forced to work jobs that they don't like in order to keep up with the rat race or where that in order to brope haply prance around whether on the job and everyone seems to have tons of time for leisure and enough money to buy giant cars the inciting inside of film were ted goes off in search of a tree isn't because someone is actually suffering from the lack of trees it's because he wants a kiss from a dreat girl next door that he has a crush on when i want more than anything in the whole world is to see a real living tree if a guy somehow got you an i probably marry him on the spot that she is not even pining for nature she doesn't want to feel forest she was wont to see a tree or back yard for the funds for the novelty of it these are the concerns of the people of neevie it ain't two shabby so oh here does it really seem to be that much of a bad guy here sure he doesn't want to grow the tree at the end of the movie but outside of that he took a desolate polluted waste land and turned it into a consumer is utopia where every one is happy sure he's rich but he's rich off of producing a product that people were willing to pay for so of her is the bad guide then surely the bad guy is the once lor inaba am the good guy here looks like some one seen en up and sort of film fareforth seriously it's hard to defend this guy considering his definitely the one to blame for all the trees being cut down a kind of i mean technically it was as overbearing mother who pushed him to the brink see we're not making pleasant and we always start chap and down the tree man it is no wonder that tumbler fell in love with this guy he's a tall sinator plain nerd who wears vest loves marsh mallow that have mammy as she owed i wouldn't around anything remember she moutons chin a motive so i re glad that you clear if i that because it actually hurt my feelings for he really long time but ye at the end of the day it's old one see who's responsible for chop and on the trees which is bad so thus he is the valance we see his back story he sets off on his own to make a business because he has a product that he believes it argono oh no you do not genesis a revolutionary product it will change the world as we know it millions and nobody believes that him nobody but nobody's going to buy that thing you goes to town every day for a week and just gets heated by the awful terrible people there like in his brutal for just as one guy and his guitar in a dream and yet despite all of his adversity he still keeps trying and you know what it eventually pays off one ferant wrong his product is something that every one wants to nais world changing product that he thought it was a sorry i just can't fold a hardworking guy with a dream who overcomes it verty to achieve tremendous success as the bad guy in this case his one fault and this is a big that he doesn't replace the trees and that not evil it's just stupid and bad business as he too quickly learns without trees his business dies there's a reason why in real life eighty to ninety per cent a newly planted trees are planted by logging and paper companies to quote from one of their website howbeit their best interest to destroy forests with no intention of replacing the trees that are used to make paper stanby of harvest able areas is crucial to the long term survival of any paper company and that means that sustainable managed forests are crucial to their business model the harvested areas for paper companies are also known as managed forests essentially detailed models are built that allow trees to be harvested sustainable for each tree that's cut down several are planted or naturally re grown in its place at a rate that keeps the environment stable point of the s forest service over four million trees are planted in the united states every day with nearly two hilliad by the paper and wood products industries river mister beasts team trees twenty million dollars for twenty million trees on amazing accomplishment right in a as but in perspective that's five days worth of planting for these companies to businesses aren't abloriak aren't evil for those reasons there business interests force them to be sustainable and that is the one lors big mistake he didn't see the forest for the trees if you'll pardon the potoo is the villain of the laura it's the consumer it's a it's easy to point at the big business guys in this case the ones ler and elevations o here and say you did this you're the one at fault for all of this but their only doing what we as the consumer are telling them to do olesha an the one lie reference the consumer at various points throughout the moving me you really think repulsive enough to buy this can we fold him for selling us a product that were telling him we want you doesn't believe it but if that's what we want he'll sell it to us and again with the one sramaneras are buying that is a telling him we approve of what you're doing cheap providing that service again full mad are just fulfilling a need that the consumer is telling them that they want for more proof once there was ready to pack up his feed business would it wasn't selling but ramtonu again when consumer demand is through the roof if it wasn't for all of those people wanting to buy a need the forest would still be intact from what we see and hear in the movie the people of neville are perfectly happy with their giant cards and their inflatable trees and their westmarsh they want those things and i know what they don't want trees at one or and here are the bad guys like the movie wants to frame it's much more complicated than that weird the bad guys here because we are the ones that let their bad business practices slide readin prioritize nature we didn't hear about the trees because we wanted a need no matter the cost we and care about air quality to worry about o'hara's pollution for change to happen it doesn't fall on them it falls on us and if we disapprove of the way some one is doing business or what a company stands for it's up to the consumer to vote with their dollar but i bolt o'hare and one or in the movie the dollars thus far had been telling of we approve what you're doing that's why this line of the movie and in the book is so important to because unless someone like you cares a whole offal nothing is going to get better it's not about the ones luristan o'haraty and that is the message of the loraine that i think most people especially illumination intertainment completely

the ape video at tell you guys i absolutely touched my take yesterday when i did a take on contagious called well poke getting a three year forty million dollar contract i completely forgot about the fact that we had his bird rights and wealth we have the money to give in that race so i apologize to you guys i'm not a hundred per cent perfect and when you're making like nine videos in a two to three days spent from time to time you just tend to mess up so i agitate and i want a clear that up to my loyal mike matier that watching on every one my videos if you want to those individuals tell me in the commentation down blind say a set now before we get to the content to one to let you guys no we really channel memberships on this channel you want to go the extremist me further as a creator there's three different tears which i support me with membership whether you want to be a mimosae under boss or a mike mafia dan if he don't then it's all good i'm happy that you're here on to that we do gaming content on a different channel called flight might t v and football content on the different channel called microphone links to that is in the description down below not a all that of the way so the in troy jugend one to one going on everybody guides i owe you apology because once again i miss out on yet another huge piece of news last night when sergey bacchus signed with the lost angels clippers for the same amount that mantras heroine with the lakes for which i had to missus well due to personal issues the personal issues are going to end after this week guide so i want to let you guys know from now on i'll be on top of each and ever you major piece of news for you guys and i'd like to applause as once again to you guesthouse you guys that they know the quicker since search o bacca to the same exact contract of the lake sign mantras herald too and i'm not a liar fancied this a little bit because well serge booing deep in search you bothering stingery boca ideas an ideal big man and an ideal pass to a championship contending team and he could theoretically say but he booted to potentially put some strain on anthony davis on the losses lakers but flankers were done wheeling and dealing to day as they go and require one of their car pieces that contributed to many championships in the earlier part of the decade by trying to best to go on a conquest to acquire mark saw those that don't know the lakers originally drafted martial in the second round about a decade ago had a tray package pretty much center on quame brown mark saw earing the key budge other pieces it was like twelve years ago to be honest for martinsart pausanias hips with coy brian and lozenges lakers made a three finals in total markably for the measles for a little bit before getting traded to the robbers to years ago and winning a championship with the rather there lot of craziness that had to go down in order for the lakers to a quire marganor first piece of invitat we have here is arimanius with a crazy was bomb tingalingaty jubilee to the cleveland cavaliers and entire trade is makin a future second round pig is going to the cleveland cavaliers blake are goin to get back out on so bekinning bell in return for the trade from markestan at high energy players jordan bellechasse laws dread and a pretty good dependency type layer although she typically has in cracked the rotation for any of the teams as a plant for recently even more a journeyman as of late aversion golden state regardless it still at good gell lakers because it is anice little young player in a young piece you could put out there in the man the unity deepening and rebounding jordan belinda player to get a twisted man real reason why the lakers traded for jordan ballena fonso makina strictly for cats bases i don't really imagine either of these players really logging in much cominetto the lakers and adrian which mouse even take time to explain why the lakers acquired these players and even traded to all the ease and actually this is a corn to body more excuses the rationale behind the main trade is the second year in maracota signing a one year contract with a bee one point six million dollar capet signing a two year deal in los angeles takes april point zillion dollar cathead one million dollar difference can go a long way when dealing with a hard cabin and also all bound to kinney and jordan bell are on non guaranteed contracts so to make the money work la will need to guarantee at least part of their salaries so they definitely going to be members of the lakers i just don't imagine them playing much this is a role that they're filling from the lakes in order to acquire markson for the lively cables as is a very typical old fashioned trade take on a contract and get a pick for doing so you're rebuilding team you're not really trying to contend it makes a lot of sense layers are clearly trying to dump jumenta so they could go after a bigger fish and all of laceration saw this cutting and looks like we were right because the very next thing we hear from aswarak is that the capacitate clears the way for the lakers to have the available money to sign mark saliently a minute later adrian words novitiate all is final izing the deal to sin with a lozenge layers sources tell me and acland j woodcotes on an says martial was drafted by the lakers but had his rights trade it to mephibosheth power he ever played in an ambage now he'll get a chance to help the lakers win back to back title toronaeans gideon a second because first of all a litel you guys how hugely gatestone lakers i don't think you guys understand now when you will get marescotti there's a very big reason why the lakers would prefer mark dissolved over to bail mike and as the bagdad he brings deep into the lakers but on to keep and he is a binomial horse basing big man he started picking the sun during his two thousand seventeen season and baptiste he shot three point six three pointers for game and he able to come bert on thirty nine per cent of that and over the years more recently when he was with toronto he was able to convert one thirty nine per cent of his three when attempting at least three points board three pointers for game now that not the only reason the lakes are bringing him in although martial is a nearly the player that he once was during his crime years of medicis best year being the two doesent thousand seventeen in bacterial distill the remarkable deep interplay er to have on your team as a matter of factoring the year that he went an bamboche toronto rappers during his time libet the metis bridles and a trotters maricha eight beds of bottles mind us of the point a and last year he was able to contribute three win chairs now atouni my bethinking trottoirs man's might be really sad about losing mark the soul no i think of anything you should be very very happy about this because take a look at this you guys are replacing martial with air and beans which the younger more defensive oriented player and a player that will fill a similar role to marsal he's on a two year fourteen point three million dollar deal i think this is a phenomenal schematic fit for the trotters as well i think this is a home run for everybody in law i think the torontos are going to get a younger player i could contribute to their correlate bits a role clare in the future and there able to replace the production at martagan them very able to move on from an older player does probably trying to chase championship the same way as brother did about a decade prior and i looks like the lakers has the big man and the personal that they want going into the season because well from here on out you're going to probably have to do your osterhaus of better and minimum contract so i mean on the common action down below what you guys think about this move do you like the fact that the lakers traded away javalies in order freestate to bring on mark the soul because honestly the holy thing a kind of hurts me about this entailed the little bit of the better send off but i don't think he's really that sad considering the fact that he you want to championship of the lakers has a fairly successful you to channel as a result of it so the later starting five now is likely going to be liberals wesley mause contagious called walpole and then davis and martial so they're going to commit to this deep pensive oriented team that frank bagoas decided to carbon identity out of i mean the commutation allow what you guys think about the starting five sides and bagnoli like and i'm dropping or make an till our next load

this of four point five million year old planet still evolving this continent shift in classic no erupt and glaciers grow and receive the earth's crust is carved in numerous and fascinating ways leaving a trail of geological mysteries behind in this episode and investigation into california san andreas fault the greatest pauline honour a hundred miles long this ugly scar on the landscape as spawned earthquake after earthquakes for now it waits quietly deep under our city telling up stress to strike once again the san andrea fault is one of the most dangerous geological features angelina's greatest city the millions of our citizens live in constant peril since records began there have been thirteen large earthquakes along the senate also america's geologists her rock detectives a warning of a potential disaster to major damage has been one in the fall of two thousand is more than three hundred scientists calculated what a major earthquake would do to southern california where centage seven point eight or quake on the sedentary damage to all buildings in the definitive scientific report presented to politicians was code named shake out it forecast thousands of deaths and billions of dollars of damage in the city of los angeles which makes it crucial to investigate the most important question when will the next big earthquake hit the canadians the latest preparations for disaster are the climax of an investigation that started more than one hundred years ago the aftermath of the great sam francisco earthquake of nineteen o six year quantuck on the wednesday just before john the ground shook violently for forty five seconds igniting fires the raged unchecked for the next four days went athos building a tent the entire city which is troyano than treetoad people one in every hundred of the population were killed with a magnitude of seven point eight it in the top twentyfourth americans strongest ever erase at the great entrance co earthquake shot the nation but no one understood what the mad the city chapter midst explained earthquakes as shots from a battle between warring spirits latterday explorers couldn't understand the shocks the destroyed their mission buildings one spanish missionary wrote that he had later shook around me from explosions or under the ground the man three hundred years later and science is still made little progress refugees and the ruins of san francisco still blamed earthquakes on mysterious underground explosion so just three days after the earthquake the state of california asked one of the world's most famous geologists and drew lasseroe california state university to investigate what had destroyed the city he and the team of twenty five scientists began collecting damage evidence in the city and surrounding country side there were roses that had but rail tracks that had twisted the most startling evidence of all that came near the town of belinus in marin county to the north of san francisco this picket fence had an eight foot gap in the middle the fore the earthquake it was a solid boundary fence dividing two fears when he recreated what had happened lostened that the land had jilted apart and torn the fence into plotting the evidence on a map around san francisco revealed a surprising patternes connecting the dots drew a straight line and at every point the earth moved in the same way on the coast to the north inland the south this line of weakness was the cupid they were searching for south of san francisco the suspect line ran underneath a lake the laguna descendre us so now the earthquake perpetrator at last had a name professor lasson who ejecate earlier had identified cracks in the earth here as a harmless rift now re christened it the san andreas fault in modern day sent francisco the buildings the roads and the railways have long sin in repaired but if you know where to look evidence of the nineteen o six queen still be found geologist charlie paul follows in the footsteps of lawson's team seeking signs of the habit from nineteen o six he finds it on the cliffs at muscle rock twelve miles south of san francisco the cliff is not here by accident as a very good reason why this cliches here half a mile or so of the shore face apparently fell off in the nineteen o six earthquake in a few yorktown below as to dig rotated block that's near the present shore line and it isn't yes in word of the sand bay a fault the san arafat is a back quarter mile off shore here the cushat's one of the major crustation some on the side of north america modern computers can now trace how damage waves spread out across the city and that pinpoint where the quake originated along the salon dress it was off shore about two miles out to sea from the golden gate bridge so to continue tracking the fall the investigation must head out to sea marine geologists use remote operating vehicles many submarines to map the sea more what you'd see is subtle variations in the deposeth of deponeth that would not naturally lie in so there might be a line on the ocean floor that is higher or lore on one side and you can use various technique to it eternally is a fault it instead of some other process running south across the sea bed the salon greasily runs out of ocean and hits the land this broken line of rocks stretching in from the sea marks where the san on drees hits land twelve miles south sanfransko and what here it muffle rock and we are santley standing on the sangraal right now and if there was an earthquake i don't know it happened right here but i wouldn't want to be a good fee this pacific coast line where cliffs crumble slowly into the sea is the boundary between two of the earth's massive continental places separated by the san andreas fault to vast separate locks of the earth's crust lie directly alongside each other here the continent of north america lies slightly on to of the adjacent section of crust which holds the pacific ocean the join can be seen where these lower dark arras are overlaid by light colored sedimentary rocks these lockyer bite by more than a hundred million years in age to walk bodies that up i'm not similar in any way if i brought together the fallin was exposed to geologists when the cliffs collapsed here in the nineteen o six earthquakes but back then nobody understood how and why the two different types of rock where next to each other until around forty years ago when the answer was finally revealed by the theory of plate tectonic the theory showed that the earth's crust consists of separate moving plates on which the oceans and continents sit around two hundred million years ago the heavy pacific ocean flake collided with north america and started sinking underneath the lighter continent professor of geophysics marsaba studies that process called subduction in his laboratory at stanford university for me millions of years prior to the existence of the senates fault the pacific plate was seducing beneath north america the bohani plate was diving down and that process went on for well well over a hundred million years so a tremendous amount of activity was occurring as the unstoppable force of one plate met the immovable object of the other they were forced to change direction about the taines ago the camoens were such that the pacific plate had to start sliding north with respect in north america and now you know that the principle motions this slighting process between the two plates and twenty million years ago the sandra fall was born it was the moving plates that crushed different types of rock together just as here at muscle rock at last the investigation knows what it is dealing with the salmon dress faults is eight hundred miles long emerging from the sea bed north of point arena in northern california and running down to the salt and sea and the south the evidence is coming together plus from the nineteen o six earthquakes such as the picket fence that was torn apart true that the land was moving connecting the docks a entities the straight line of the san andreas poland muscle rock uncovers different plates of the earth's crust on either side of the babu investigators still need more information about how often a sanariapo pertain the past it might help them answer the all important question when will a anandraz strike again to discover when the senate fault will strike again the investigation needs to know about ancient earthquakes that have struck along the foul line but there's an immediate problem here in california it's a particular challenge and some of the earliest written records were from the missions and from the early explorers so only dating back into the eighteenth century here other parts of the world we have in requite history going back the lenient investigation moved three hundred fifty miles south of san francisco to a desert where the senates may have been active for thousands of years there's crucial evidence here about birth quakes from ancient times this creek used to flow straight across the sandra's fault here but several earthquakes form a natural down where the sandrasan wedges up here in front of me that created a small plane and now were looking at the dry sediments of that pond that record the history of earthquakes and that tells us quite a great deal about the past behaviour of the senarius fault some of the clues are so small that hunus detective work gets him down and dusty among tiny cracks inside befoore we can find out about the past behaviour of the sandra's fault by looking at the tiniest details at the bottom of this small ancient pond but sediment collected above a fine line of pebbles then an earthquake shifted the land upwards on one side of the vertical falling so this layer was originally flat and then in a subsequent earthquake it was broken like this along this tiny sacre strand of the senator is false but finding proof that this is the sight of an ancient earthquake is only part of the story but not needs to know how long ago it happened the bare rock layers are no help in dating his find but just above the fracture line of the rocks he is found be evidence he needs here a bush was burned by a pretoria wildfire and that remnant of carbon is wife see this black stain on the side of the trench wall the key to unlocking the age of the rocks is carbon fourteen now as radio carbon its molecular structure means that carbon fourteen is a more unstable iatan other forms of carbon its absorbed by growing plants then radioactive decays at a known range after the plant dies so measuring carbon fourteen in vegetation burned in a wild fire reveals how long ago those plants die and dates the rock in which the carbon is found and through this we can reconstruct the evidence of the past earthquakes radiocarbon dating his proved that earthquakes have been happening along the line of the san and drafts of yours the particular small earthquake investigated by hunno for example is around free and a half thousand years old it happened at a time when the last lemaire outre investigation moved to an even more remote desert spot the carizo playing one hundred sixty miles north of los angeles here lies a dried up river bed which takes an unusual course coming down on the hills the creek bed takes a sudden sharp turn to its right a few hundred feet later it makes an equally odd ninety degree turn to the left the creek crossed the line on the salandra spot but early geologists were mystified why did it bend in this way the scientific pioneer were lime to studies on the ground nowadays had not has an advantage he can take into the air but tanagras all where it cuts through the coriolanus aloike a scar and it was caused by repeated erikson the past along the long line of hills marking the course of the sun and dress put nut spots that puzzling bends that he seek oh if we could see a lot of all through here that would be of a altered at right angle one channel with the ego and it right there at the classic on right there but not real view of the creek bed shows that the river once flowed straight on across the fall but little by little a searing of earthquakes along the san andres dragged the creek away from its original course recreating how the land had moved showed hugenot that the two parts of the creek had travelled more than three hundred feet apart the imaginant american plates six and a pacific plates moving potentest the wallet creek it records that offset because the channel was straight across the calm but it's been off set three times earlier investigators had already radiocarbon dated the land on each side of the faultering that it took three thousand years to change the creeks position so now in the distance and the time it took to do it let's hunt not calculate the average speed with which the two land masses are moving past each other three hundred feet in three thousand years one foot projected just over an inch a year but this was never a steady sliding one inch year movement the reality was a series of sudden small jumps whenever tension built up and up between the two moving plates to overcome friction between the ranks and ripped the land a part with an earthquake it's an important moment for the investigation knowing how fast the land is moving not only reveals the stress that building up at also the risk of an earthquake the senarian is giving up its secrets cloom a long dried up pond revealed the sight of ancient earthquakes carbon from a pressoir provides the dates and then in a river bed prove how fast the plates are moving along the salon drest now the investigation has a new mystery to so if the land along the salon dresses moving one inch every year causing earthquake then why has one small town along the falloner had at the investigation has discovered how fast the land is stretching and straining along each side at the canadians which should help establish when that ever increasing stress will snap the land apart the next major earthquake but there's a problem one part of the folie just doesn't fit the pattern the small town of hollister is unique along the san andrea alister it's never had an earthquake and the investigation is going to find out why politer has a population of thirty seven thousand and nothing here is quite the way it should be there are plenty of plumes suggesting that the land must be moving here sidewalks with cracks curbstone out of line the walls that bent out of shape walking through hollister with cansean thing that man has built that was laid out in a straight line may have a job in it the every year it changes a little bit and sufferers of sang the clues add up to one clear conclusion even without any earthquakes peert this town in the heart of the salandra a system still slides imperceptibly slowly and effort this leelang in and one sense the damages here for so shaded with a creeping is clearly sort of under control for ever geologist if you start playing that out for a tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions of years the consequences of that become enormous for many years the creeping ground that moves without earthquake remained an unsolved mystery but then the investigation moved one hundred miles south to another small community where the land also creeps along the village of part field has a population of just thirty seven people and a bridge which spans right across the salandra pals the bridge separates the pacific plate on one side from the north american plate on the other and the bride railings had started to ben i'm my right now in a pacific plate on the west side of the sand result and hathersage comes off the flank of that hill and right across that field right under the bridge and then right over by the corner that billie that fence posts and then on off to middlemount the movement he eround the bridge is strikingly similar to the slow creeping ground of hollister but there is one important difference here in part field every couple of decades are so this village does have earthquakes there just little tremors but they're big enough to be recorded on heartquake monitoring sizemore that's why the village proudly boasts of being the earthquake capital of the world but it's perhaps more accurately called the earthquake study capital because scientists are fascinated by the fact that bertha's here follow a predictable pattern elsewhere birthrates always strike without warning the toll of death and destruction made worse because nobody knew they were coming so scientists are desperate for any clue that might help predict when an earthquake could happen and here in part feel the earthquakes happen with astonishing regularity on average every couple of decades or so minor quakes happened here in eighteen fifty seven eighteen eighty one nineteen o one nineteen twenty two nineteen thirty four and nineteen sixty six after the sixty six earthquake investigators set up a network of monitoring instruments to see if the fault gave any warning before the next earthquake arrive they expected it some time between nineteen eighty eight and nineteen ninety three but it was late and months of waiting stretched into years but still the scientists waited until finally in december to thousand four the long awaited earthquake arrived and was caught on phil from annolith worn and damaged camera the earthquake movie may not have seemed that impressive but the instruments collected a mass of information the data didn't after all help with earthquake prediction but it did pinpoint where the earthquake started underground which told investigators were to look next deep down under the part field countryside starting slightly to one side of the foe the aim was to angle in and stab into the very heart of the san andrea after three years of drilling long cors of rock were extracted from the exact spot where the earthquake occurs this was the first time the team leader geologist mark so back had ever seen rocks from the center of the senate what we're looking at here are course from the act of sanada from a depth of about two miles he so for the earth tiens community these are like moonrock as we were trying to exude these course we had a great deal of juliette the sandres fault was literally fighting back after nine weeks of attempting to recover the course in the middle of a huge lightning storm almost a scene directly out of hollywood with the thunder and lightning these course came to the surface and so was a tremendous feeling of satisfaction the lightning and thunder dismayed that much more dramatic and were all wearing gloves we did an oil from our fingers to affect the core and the rule was that you touched the core as lilas polemia lack the reality was we couldn't help ourselves and it was just such a remarkable thing to be action looking at the senatorial of for the very first time that the we all got the touch and a little bit buried within the rock course they found a vital clue about the way that land slipped along the salon drays they found serpentine sir pen made is an unusual rock type it was originally formed at the base of the ocean cross and some up on to the continent but the reason that serpent it is so interesting is that spennie is very easily altered to tell it allows the lock to slide at very low force levels its dompter is very slippery to crystalline structure soft sliding flat plants makes it one of the slipperiest rocks on one societes talk could well be a key mineral in deciding how the fault is actually working in central california we see that the secret of the slipping sandres fault is actually the walks themselves the talk explains the tiny earthquakes of park field nobody's yet thrilled to investigate the rocks at hollister but scientists suspect that to is present there to bracing the walls show the land creek in hollister and a bend in the bridge reveals the same creeping ground in a nearby town rockport from the folk contained serpentines leading investigators to the softest and slipperiest mineral town which lubricates some parts of the for the investigation is having success but one crucial question remains to be answer what will the salandra fat do next the investigation into the san andrea paul is trying to predict when and where its next major earthquake will strike so far the only certain prediction is the far distant future of the san andreas looked twenty million years ahead if the plate movements continued to follow their patterns los angeles will end up becoming a suburb of san francisco but predictions on a shorter time scale or more difficult if you would ask the question can we predict ertak's my answer would be no because i know what your question really meant is you know can we predict a north quake as in a car on a certain fault at a certain time that we can specify in the future and we cannot do that but there are millings we can predict we can predict which faults are likely to produce the bigger quakes we can predict how big earthquakes are likely to be and we can even predict the probability of the earthquake occurrence over some period of several decades for dictions are most crucial where the san andreas runs to the south of la here in the cache a valley desert geological evidence of earthquakes stretches back fifteen hundred years and more and they follow a regular pattern major earthquake strike here with monotonous regularity every two hundred years but the latest one is long overdue there hasn't been an earthquake here from more than three hundred years that's a concern because parts of the sentry as false system run straight from fear towards the city of los angeles the faults will transmit earthquake shocks in a straight line towards california biggest city geologist you retoc regularly monitors how the ground goes on either side of the fault line the lines up his ps equipment precisely over a series of metal pegs fixed into the ground this information this crucial for estimating how fast the faultless adopt and what is the rate of accumulation of strain in the croft in other words how close the crust is brought to failure by a slip at of the folded dealt the repeated atropos measurements revealed at land here on the surface carlyle at all this is a problem because deep underground was dresses in strains or still building up the fall in laying a doubt at the fair lehigh speed and this the formation is growing and growing and growing with five miles underground the deep fault is moving at more than an inch a year which tells the augur that in the centuries since the last wake the surface should have shifted three hundred inches twenty five feet or more but it hasn't so sooner or later something's got to give and the acosta that something will be the rocks themselves and i want example is this type of rock which is cold a granite in fact the rock out of which most of the earth craft is made the microscope reveals the crystalline structure of the granite the crystals make the rocks tough but they have a hidden weeks the bonds between they suddenly crack under stress basically wants this material so a defies ah it is able to crack and the sheer on a full surface the brittle behaviour of these races what lies behind the physics of frequent rocks underlie all of the san andreas fault but right here the rocks under greater stress than anywhere else because it so many centuries since a major quantock and now were aver the three hundred year limit and so it means not all the strain moutains being accumulated on the fault at this point is very close to the maximum strain at this full has ever seen through it logic record and this is a full that is capable of generating great destructive earthquakes falco believes the coming quake could be the big wood that people have been talking about for years effects could be the rift because of the population density of southern california when the last huge quake occurred three hundred years ago los angeles was just a tiny spanish mission community with fewer than one hundred people now it's america's second largest city with almost eleven million people living in the earthquake vulnerable metropolitan area people wholly in california probably xperience a smaller and moderate sizers quigalta moving in your house but it's really actually kind of fonder is no measure destruction people just along with their life my bigger advance on other hand or quite a bit different story with the threat to los angeles becoming ever clearer the investigation is nearing its conclusion tata repeated dips measurements in the desert reveal evidence that stress is building up while examination of the rocks of the crust show they may not take the stramash longer than all the evidence points towards a potentially huge earthquake building up and seven california and new experiments suggests the coming quake could be far worse than any one has ever imagined there is new urgency in the investigation into the senator's fault as revealed by recent evidence compiled by three hundred of america's most respected scientist they worn that los angeles will be devastated a major quake strikes along the southern section of the fault mine while there has it in a major quake for hundreds of years even small ones can still be deadly let the north retortii struck this la suburb in nineteen ninety four rectory along an offshoot of the main san andreas fault the quake was only a magnitude six point seven considered moderate on the scale of earthquake measurements but it still killed seventy two people an injured twelve thousand homes and new evidence suggests mother nature might have a lot more in store for los angeles scientists at long know that earthquakes generates several distinct sets of ways they travel a difference beans each spreading damage and destruction out from the episode modern city buildings in earthquake prone areas like california are engineered to cope with such ways now new research by geophysicist professor aris resolus suggests that the san andreas may offer a new and even more deadly threat resolus researches how earthquakes rupture a long straight line falls just like the salon dreams where it approaches los angeles he creates his own many earthquakes representing the san adrea's fault by a hairline crack in a thick transparent block this special material shows up internal stress lines when its lit by a laser and the earthquake is triggered by a tiny explosion three to a sea inaasava tananas began appetitive a cracker then than all trahi speed camera capturing ten million frames a second reveals a startling and newly discovered phenomenon this frozen picture reveals stress lines speeding along the many san andreas in the milly seconds after the explosion the cone to the left of this brain is a previously unrecognized type of shock wave racing along the rupture line from the earthquake center on a microscopic scale it looks and moves exactly like the sonic boom produced when a supersonic aircraft such as concord breaks the sound barrier because we also see macondray as from his evolving elaine and just like a son a boom it can be dangerous in same sense we hear that on a worm the conqueror and confident fool from the abate danger comes because many high rises just aren't built to come with extra stress from this molly discovered type of shock wave so if you are at all wellinformed sake one way you will aguadiente that you get very strong ground shaking as other types of waves coming also the high speed rubbed the resources called superheated where folks run in a strain line which might help explain a one hundred year old miss merle rounding the great caranco quintara disaster which launched the entire salandra investigation the overwhelming damage san francisco has long seen surprisingly out of proportion to the seven point eight magnitude the quaking and there's a particularly straight section of the san andreas approaching san francisco so many scientists now believe that the damage was greater than expected because the nineteen o six quake had travelled at superheated of greater concern to modern emergency services is not what happened the century ago but what could happen to morrow because there is a similar straight section of falterona heading straight towards los angeles and if a superheated develops on that line than the consequences could be disastrous all of the investigations warnings about the senate's came together in the fall of two thousand eight with the biggest earthquake drilled ever held in california if this earther quake word of happened in reality go sould have been building coming down the minor would be no water on sonare that's what i exercise is all about but what are the real chance of los angeles soon being hit by a massive earthquake frightening the best scientific consensus now warns that there's a ninety nine per cent chance of a major quake in southern california within the next thirty years to better understand the threat to la the geologist produced their study jointly with experts in charge of the city's disaster plan and none of them doubt that the big quake is coming i relate even a question of if any more the shaking is going to be severe for two to three minutes and then it's goin to stop then you had that moment of silence at off the tapes before you start here in the car alarms all the other sounds and cabinetsrath study estimates that a major earthquake in the la metro harry would cause two thousand deaths fifty thousand injuries and two hundred billion dollars of damopolon and the blocks will be on fire that's the kind of name are scenario that were looking at this specter of disaster to california's people and cities motivates the search to unravel the secrets of the senora's banal the evidence finally in the gemer from the nineteen o six disaster show the faults eight hundred mile path the different types of rock at muscle rock provide clues to how the fault was created twenty million years ago the river bars prove how fast to land is more a mineral town explains why some parts slip without major plates the brittle granite rock revealed a threat to los angeles and recent lad experiments uncovering new and more dangerous earthquake shock way but one god has alluded the rock detectives who study the greatest fault line on earth when with the sleeping salandra come to life once again it could be any time the only certainty is that nothing is certain in the ever evolving story of how the earth maintaining

so what did we do after we found that silk i wish i could say we just toss it in the bin and went on our days i normal competent human beings but now nay we just had to get involved ewe decided to give this all our attention a bigger we all got too much time and we got no future we set down to siboney table and started inspecting it not even joking when i say we spent a good ten minutes trying

time while they were on one side picking out me i was on the other looking at eggs in between that was the cookie section nurse some guy on the scooter not even seconder this man crashes straight into the cooking like a scattered all over the floor bakery that as her loss a hundred dollars sir you good we went over to help him clean up and i could not believe when i saw that he got off the scooter

stairs another time she asked me about bread here i think you should throw the spread out why what's wrong with it agates perfectly fine perfectly fine pleasantly or and here we go i decided i wanted

become immune to crop boot maybe even get super powers for it what i'll give you fifty dollars teetotal if you end up in the hospital i see i think i'd heard anything on some nights i'd sit down on magatama discuss important matters and she would listen to a word i said because she was just focused on one thing okay ilka would you rather jump into a pool of lemon juice while your body's covered in paper cut or drink garbage get off my dissel love the festal say i to a colour something on the ceiling above her bed one time she refused to sleep until it was gone next thing you know all of us are gathered in a room okay hear me out this will be much easier if we were allowed to use your bed as a foot stool hell no you ain't step in foot on my bed so we resorted to other complicated methods i got an umbrella bibles got a broom stick and never remained tempted away yeah go team than god nobody loves above us i kept in the ceiling but my aim was either wife that night for this bogota good reflexes to kinch me you to loathe a foe on the floor he was started losing her mind i got or we go on a wagon and even though i got smacked with the broom it was still moving he started playing foot yont the bug went splat well we done our deed winking that was it and to this day the cockroach got or polly still on that ceiling if i ever got the chance dorman in my adit doesn't really guaranty

so we are here to day and simply course to prosecute the illegal use and frankly misuse of pictures videos of simply no odicals male for the purposes astronomical every one is merest in again and some one some people a trying to steal my identity my nail identity my mail density that's right companies have been using my pictures and my videos for years now to sell their products with the big permission and you know what i've had enough bear have been tweeting and emailing and messaging me pictures and videos of random companies using my face and my now and i think you in records we got all the evidence to day to present in court i have binders finders of affidavits to forget to subscribe to sit on the jury turn that red button green wait no it doesn't turn green a turn can you the defendant of this case are random fast fashion companies of the internet that are not here to day with us because they are scared and if they are here then thanks for the view is cases road by the corps under copyright and or trademark law but also under common sense business texts of the case here are straightforward rode companies that no one has ever heard of are using my pictures videos without my permission on the internet to solder product to make a dominie this year there was a new story about how companies are sealing influences basis for profit but what they fail to mention is that they are not only feeling our faces they are stealing our name nobody partisan here was vexed picotee to sell your feet run things oneself him socks i don't think so says these companies are losers and i want to send money on lawyers subtract on every single one of them because even if we did do that it wouldn't really work because a lot of the clerics and thus nothing we can really do any ways i know because we have tried but to day we're going to focus on the types of stolen content rather than the companies of overtakes these are right enter evident i guess go bang this first of all i would like to extend a thank you to the simply in a logical for gathering all the evidence and bringing all these violations to the attention of the court without your eagle eyes and tweet communication we would have no such evidence to present to day so thank you tolerate detected them there if i have become a private investigator and a higher aheat for they have my footage my nail and we boyled actually living or cause it's mere grim as it is cetacean mere nail polish was but irascaris this you i know that black desk and those candy cornells weenter video another tick tock i need this now i kawaihae and this one you can see my water mark by simply an elliott world's first mere crown miltonic is a joke because it's not actually wolfert should have to watch that original video to the extasy now i know that i recognized my own cliff and this proof because the water mark but just in case you are a cure which could were mine roll the glint this does not look like normal now polished to me and it does not apply like harmonious look at that ship what to and that in evidence proves on you tube posted however many years ago acute same content being used on pin trappers an as disappointing as these cut out my water mark in his video there shady and they know it so having water marked is a really good idea i recommend it for any content readers but he when your feet isn't in it it does prevent again some misuse i think an it does say like missus mind so packard's possible that some of concretion user stuff anyway it moving on the face and who is this ideal meat edelweiss she wore on her head cabaner is a dose of glamr you say good bye to boring nails to it i write this to the chosen and i mention it resists for a video but they chose the picture where the silver crom was reflecting from a hollow background i have which isn't even representative of what that product actually looked like which is just silver mirror so so i to every one who is a missile on that long laughing hankinson say that the polish will only last around six hours and other video from shopping bel on fatoo to co proceeded up be not the same product used in this at ice cream jelly why would they be selling milroth world's first near liquid polish wow it looks like batoche other companies video and cropped back video to this is like thieves seeing from thieves or how did you give them permission to use your video in this as for their products absolutely not the answer is no and you can assume its always now and less i have preserved with that company or shown in some way that i have a relationship with them something that is clear that i consented to it are we citified that my mere come nails content has been used in abuse by random yes we are order order order and on the internet o my god be cleared though aren't my nail and i have no idea what going on her was being written is i can't refinish but thou was my face why are they using my face there is you recitals was near thee oh my god i think set with come of video on like a subscriber nail polish give in pretty sure for small i am shocked at this company used my face because no one uses my face i know a fabriana at gleaned good ascarides and feminine form of gringo is a variety of tales which consist of a flower tourteville with cheese furnature dictionary says something different a female native speaker of english grena's often defined as disparaging sling for a ford female in latin america quote this gringoire from the airport wits is that is it me tanagras late says a new fever among green does that mean like the new hottest trend among white girls okay anyway he's in i have no idea what dead corals for it de multicolor go home so much evidence to need a t break please take one there's an idea that's using haliotide from their video of guessing they didn't pay you they never put a think i know what this is from what why did that visual of my ear make any one think i want to put that on my face find you a random consumer on the internet nice he that i'm like i am certainly not by just in case the court and the audience is not aware at these images are from simplicifolia with multiform up is the safe question mark ello else in this james is it this easy to look this good women are crazy over this colour changing its taken yep i look crazy ones a bunch of other artists contented stolen and well such italians me if i sit windlike left go took port smooth silky bodies sponsored it's off the this might tonelli now did you agree to this no objec o what i agree to anything sponsored by smooth silky bodies it also seemed my motion nail us quite a bit particularly my multi chrome raindrop nails but move on to exhibit a hollow powders and coil do see that where it says a maya that's exactly where my water mark is as they so clearly lord albeit crazy is yes these companies know that their taking images that arthur own but to picture them or someone works to them sitting there oosha out the owner of that content and then writing the other companies may on top of it like you know your doing something rather account nay my intermitted shop too i wonder what happened to a miandasht on manicure and create your family that's what i say great protesting all look one in the comments stolen content you say your products are for women but steal from female creators well said moving on now to exhibit i don't know because those just so many what if i told you that my nails are under play at real life establishments that you can walk right into nailing look what i just saw i a nailfile met they made a poster of your thumbnail and put his in their window the odd that beatty a tube to it on the one hand i can see why for them it's a very easy thing to just print it put in the window so you don't have to do any work and maybe they are selling disowned but it's like i obviously didn't give permission to this mail alone to use my pictures to make profit basically a ganlook the salon name because i don't actually won't people going there or i don't want people attacking them on social media and understand that you know sometimes it's hard to run a business out of his line of mediating to do your best to get customers in the door that doesn't mean it's okay to use other people content but i'm not trying to destroy their business here but what i am an you is not return the favor and give them any business by showing their names so well was called them all soon x not exeats just just at one a sad no article sores dis powder wall well getting minutes another salon has printed out to mason and then i think we have another entry from a differs who saw the exacting picture in the same salon and at a local mallandane never been to so i grabbed their priceless one picture on the back to look the superfamilies the choice by appointment only shaame i belike i want that exactly that and another one blind as picture so popular i knew something in my local malolo and looked formiliar my right bo grow a while i guess a pretty big picture hat the print that i found the shopping and argentina looks like there was a t v screen playing one of my really old videos by nails woke up like this batch had the sad thing here is a that's how i used to title my video o bein my friend were walking around the town when we saw nilotica the utu radio thomasine and allot we offer a nail art mabeli neleus atene dubufe designs bason an in a weird to see you to be some bills printed out on to like paper and stuck out a wall in real life that's apropos there maybe one of these days i should go to a slant maybe get a haircut nocent probably still her moving on to the elastic iver we have random at misenus miss amelia's random things that people have so informed that cannot be put into any one category because there's just so many little things that a nail mine old on alegres and pretty sure those are clinked tea nails that i used and in pretty sure that's not what i express selling even if even if but say that the quality of the new vitalised here is the exact same as the product that i used to create that picture the cousin is still wrong for using my content my picture to sell their products we understand this right i'm just check has simply agr i just saw this on an adam hinterest with your video i late tax free nail apron and i'm not sure if you approve this just one until a you know thank you for lessing you know no i did not prove it the perfect life so dotcom i don't think so because stealing is not a good life style reading down the pathway of crime wettin instrumented ad within is for a hallooed for smoothing base maeander thousand yes but that a cnosian for your weak nails that my tea i moiled this but as from like four years ago and got a collection of other women's nails that agora sand had stolen though there be there vilderbeeste rise and nourish the mail get yours here were they talking about peter the nail peg i'll see you to visit quite incredible like their selling an alien that it had a preacher of me a work i order order and a gordonia planning on buying all these products trying them and in showing you how they are what the advertised to be or maybe they were just garbage but then i changed my mind because why at last supporting a hole even if yes i made this video and i am publicly shame them but then i also giving them like forty bucks because they use pictures of my name i must supporting this so members of the court members of the jury i know their probably wondering what to these companies gain by using images that are so obviously to most sonetti a quick turn round but that for sure it's like fast fashion but her nails but in doing that there is no grand awareness that they gain and certainly no brand value that their building because no one remembers their brand may they probably restart new brand names every month i imagine that some of these companies of have been shuttered by a copyright infringement claims in that's why you're seeing like to shop number two this also happens when fans like you guys flood comment and call them out francis deivetas feel forced to just start ever as now using the same tenure but now starting over one thing that i think we can only agree on in this court is that it helps influences and celebrities whose images are being misused when you tell them about it and also when you come on the company's post and you say this is stolen it helps other consumers be educated on that fact because the subjects who may not realize may be best on now that influence or that saint the these that they're like oh i don't want to buy from a company who steal other people's tastes as to short do not support these companies if you want to support him since and if you hate influences so kay we all do some of them men don't support these companies because they are lying about what the product is because they're using photos at areotha product and therefore they are probably full of shearith tinkered for our clothing statements here we the simply corps find the defendant guilty of using simply an illogical nails and her face for some warricombes of profit we hear by sentence you to hiring your own photographer and paying artists for their work i know this might sound like a harsh punishment but i think it's proportional to the crimes companies who stealing my chitterin so much for joins courtroom never stopped weeding the violation at me thanks so much for what in an all sayonara bushed the game railheads

these denationalisation and then only on a majority the mathematician attention
